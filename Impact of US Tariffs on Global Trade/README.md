# 📊 Impact of U.S. Tariffs on the Global Economy

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes how the recent tariffs imposed by the United States have impacted global trade, focusing on:

- GDP changes
- Export losses
- Country-wise dependency on U.S. markets
- Key sectors affected

**Note:** I created and cleaned the dataset entirely by myself and built this Power BI dashboard independently, without using any tutorials.
